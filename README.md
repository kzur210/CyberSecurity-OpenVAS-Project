# CyberSecurity-OpenVAS-Project
Semester project: Vulnerability scanning using OpenVAS
This project demonstrates a controlled vulnerability assessment using OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager).

Project Highlights:
1. Configured an isolated lab environment with Metasploitable2, an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine.
2. Performed network scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability detection using OpenVAS on Linux.
3. Generated comprehensive reports analyzing potential risks and configuration issues.
4. Documented challenges and implemented solutions to improve scanning methodology and analysis accuracy.
